                <h3>Budgeting</h3>
                <p>Setting a budget before your trip helps you control expenses and avoid financial stress. Plan a daily budget that covers accommodations, food, transportation, and activities. Keep track of your spending using a travel budget app to stay within your limits.

Booking flights and accommodations in advance can save you a lot of money. Use comparison websites to find the best deals, and consider flexible travel dates to take advantage of lower prices. Look for budget-friendly accommodations such as hostels, guesthouses, or vacation rentals instead of high-end hotels.

Public transportation is often cheaper than taxis or rental cars. Many cities offer tourist passes for unlimited travel, which can be a cost-effective option. Walking or cycling is not only budget-friendly but also allows you to explore your destination in a more immersive way.

To avoid excessive currency exchange fees, use travel-friendly debit or credit cards that offer low or no foreign transaction fees. Withdraw cash in larger amounts to minimize ATM fees, and always choose to pay in the local currency to avoid unfavorable exchange rates.</p>
