                <h3>Budgeting Wisely</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Set a daily budget that covers accommodations, food, transportation, and activities. Use a travel budget app to track spending and stay within your limits.</li>
                    <li>Book flights and accommodations in advance to save money. Use comparison websites and be flexible with travel dates to find the best deals.</li>
                    <li>Use public transportation instead of taxis or rental cars to cut costs. Many cities offer tourist passes for unlimited travel.</li>
                    <li>Avoid excessive currency exchange fees by using travel-friendly debit or credit cards with low or no foreign transaction fees.</li>
                </ul>

                    <li>Bring a power bank to keep your devices charged on long travel days. A universal adapter ensures that you can charge your electronics anywhere.</li>
